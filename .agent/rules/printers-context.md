## FlashForge Printers

## AD5X (**NOT** "Adventurer 5X" or something else..)
This *is* part of the "5M series" , but is a *special* model for multi-color/multi-material printing. 
It is eqiupped with the "IFS", which manages the 4 slots for multi material/color.

This model does NOT have a built in camera, and does NOT come with LEDs installed by the factory.
Filtration is NOT enabled/supported on this printer (without customizations).

## Adventurer 5M / Adventurer 5M Pro
These printers are both part of the "5M series", all core specs are the same.

Like the AD5X, the regular 5M does NOT have a built in camera, or LEDs installed by the factory

The 5M pro is the **only model** which comes with a built-in camera, and LEDs installed by the factory.
All three models support installing an OEM camera (addon), as well as OEM or aftermarket LEDs.

Additionally, the regular 5M does NOT have filtration control, this is another feature exclusive to the 5M pro. It has internal/internal filtration and is able to report the "TVOC" level
