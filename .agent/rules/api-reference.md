Whenever you are writing or updating and documentation in this repository, you MUST be factually correct

**ALWAYS** consult "real-world" usage patterns in the `ai_reference` folder

- `ff-5mp-api-ts` - This is a cross-platform TypeScript API for FlashForge printers
- `flashforgeui` - This is a cross-platform GUI for monitoring & controlling FlashForge printers, powered by `ff-5mp-api-ts`

**NEVER** make *any* assumptions about the API, printer capabilities, how something is done , or anything else. 
**ALWAYS** verify accuracy and correctness by consulting these reference folders

If you are unsure about **anything** , stop and ask.
